Banana Republic:
 - Does glk_stylehint_set(wintype=33, styl=3 (Header), hint=3 (Size), val=0), trying to set on type 33, which naturally segfaults.

A Tight Spot:
 - Colors not supported
 - Make TextGrid output use ' ' instead of '&nbsp;'?
 - Char input ends up capitalized, because it's not letting the browser apply normal character semantics?

- Up-arrow in text box should allow command history?
- widen text box?

curses
 - DONE: Gets the windows confused somehow?
 - DONE: Spews error messages
 - No newline after echoed user input.
 - Save echos strange garbage to screen -- tries to output save file
   to current stream, rather then to save file stream!

DONE: How to restore, from new.
 - advent: line input "restore\n"
 - blue-lacnua: char input "r"
 - alabaster: line "yes\n", char space, line "restore\n"
 - acg: line "restore\n"
 - king: char "r"
 - curses: N/A
 - zork1: N/A
 - emy: char space, line "restore\n"
 - sd3: line "foo\n", line "restore\n"

From user testing:
 - Make scrollbar more obvious -- see, for ex, just after answering art or love in blue lacuna
 - In blue lacuna, ret with no input should do 'look'.
 - Double-check if blue lacuna should have a status bar visible during the prelude.
 - make 'go' button for the mouse-obsessed.
 - DONE: make restore have a list of available games.
 - have a production URL
 - google ads?
 - empty input line before sending ajax, stack up calls?
 - set focus on input box, on load + redraw
 - after save, set scrollheight

earl grey
 - Bottom "thinking" window ends up 400 pixels high, like all textbuffers.

king
 - <div style="height: 1 px"><div class='TextGrid' id='winid0x95e83f0'> -- get needs to know about height/width in chars vs pixels.
 - Block vs inline elements for styles -- centred text not working, text background color only set directly behind text.
 - Inline graphics in textbuffers
 - Exiting the printworks more then once will end up with multiple graphics windows, since we do not support close.
 - DONE - Size info on graphic windows. - DONE
 - DONE - redraw implicitly clears TextBuffer?
 - DONE - Graphics - DONE

blue-lacuna
 - DONE - help menu is not usable, because there is no way to press enter.
  - DONE - JS to capture key onchange of input textfield, and if Return/cursor key etc, send "evtype_CharInput Return\n"
  - DONE - see event.c line 131.
 - Mucking about with style of hinty window doesn't work, because the window is never deleted

acg
 - Working!

alabaster
 - The Imager remains 42 px high, because the browser keeps the Graphics div at minimal height.
 - Attempt to muck about with game's own config file still not working (doesn't like opening file that isn't preexiting?)
 - Graphics
  - DONE - graphics window is invisible; javascript will not create new windows that didn't exist.
  - DONE - window_fill_rect  - extern void glk_window_fill_rect(winid_t win, glui32 color, glsi32 left, glsi32 top, glui32 width, glui32 height);
  - DONE - image_get_info    - extern glui32 glk_image_get_info(glui32 image, glui32 *width, glui32 *height);
  - DONE - image_draw_scaled - extern glui32 glk_image_draw_scaled(winid_t win, glui32 image, glsi32 val1, glsi32 val2, glui32 width, glui32 height);

advent
 - DONE: help menu, putting a \x0A to a TextGrid doesn't move the cursor
 - DONE: help menu: window_set_arrangement and window_get_parent don't work via dispatch.
 - DONE: help menu: gets cleared "for us" after 'n'.

zork1
 - DONE: Gets the windows / streams confused somehow?
 - DONE: No visible output
 - DONE: After typing a line into the apparently empty screen, you can see output, but with no newlines in the game's output, and extra red error messages: "[ERROR: save]: incorrect stack size assessment (0) 22800 (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10)"
 - Missing newline after echo.

emy
 - Done: initial working!
 - DONE: Save: needs "???glk_fileref_create_by_prompt usage=1 (SavedGame), filemode=1 (Write)"
 - DONE: Save does not work.
  - TEST FOR EMY SAVE:
  - (echo 80 25; echo 80 25; echo 80 25; echo 'evtype_CharInput 32'; echo 80 25; echo 80 25; echo 'evtype_LineInput enter'; echo 80 25; echo 80 25; echo evtype_CharInput 110; echo 80 25; echo 80 25; echo evtype_LineInput save; echo /tmp/emy-test.sav) | /mnt/shared/projects/games/flash-if/garglk-read-only/terps/agility/glkagil ../../Emy\ Discovers\ Life/DISCOVER
  - glkagil: os_glk.c:6268: gagt_get_user_file_glk: Assertion `retfd != -1 && retfd == glkfd' failed.
 - All writes go to one window?
 - Proper support for glk_style_measure



sd3:
 - After a, b, c menu, doesn't scroll back to top.

workflow:
 glk:window_size?
 game: send_window_size (callback)
  if no size, exit glk loop, return data (redraw windows?) to browser
    set current_select to window data for this window, input_type='size'
    sends redraw / complete html data, windows with no content.. ?
    browser sends new window sizes, set_window_size calls continue?
     - removed as this then skips the 2nd/3rd set..

  else send window size data

universal
 - DONE - TextBuffer window grows instead of scrolling. - DONE
 - DONE - No way of pressing ret during char input makes most help menus unusable.
 - DONE - <title> tags. - DONE
 - DONE? - expand Game::Window to cover all window attrs
 - add Game::Style ?
 - DONE - ajax: return json/content per window, instead of just one - DONE
 - DONE - continue, return content without divs/classes etc. - DONE
 - DONE - make TextGrid excempt from pages garbage?
 - DONE - make get_own_formatted_text part of Game::Window::*?  Likewise ->move_cursor, etc?
 - DONE - Chrome: hitting up or down in a charinput box makes the autocomplete thingy show up. - DONE
 - Graphics windows force the browser to re-get the image every turn, even if it has not changed.

 - saving
  - DONE - type "save", Game responds by running "save_file_name" callback, exits loop, and user is shown save form instead of normal input form (contains "username" and "save game" fields)
 - Re-use input form, by making username universal?
  - add hidden username field / user sessions?

 - output hint about the maximum length of an input line, and verify before sending to game itself
  - truncate or error on "too long"?

 - Handle game titles with html metacharacters.
 - s/Game/GlkNew/ in all module names?

 - front page:
  - DONE: Initial: List of game links to click on for new game - TT/View including looking up list of games?
   - DONE: Also links to github checkout / github issues list
  - DONE: Need to extract the "list of games" data somewhere both Game::Catalyst and Game::Everything else will see it? maybe into the conf file for the app? (and load with config::any elsewhere or pass in)
 - DONE: Allow user to login and display customised front page, including users games player with resume links?
 - DONE: Need to extract "games for this user" code so cat can see it.. or make available outside a Game::HTML object?
 - DONE: How to "restore" a game from a link to the save file?
 - is this the same save/re-open code that allows us to stop relying on the @games array globally?

 - get rid of @games array.
 - DONE: need to test how each game starts/can be restored.. generally, send "r" or "restore" as first command on select?
 - what about games that ask for window size first?
